                            we want to spotlight the deep local talent pool of our island. With increased representation through art
                            and music, we want this festival to inspire the youth of Sri Lanka to pursue their passions in the
                            creative arts by providing them with a platform to reach all corners of the world. The name Serendisco is
                            inspired by Sri Lanka’s old name ‘Serendib’ which is also the word that ‘Serendipity’ was derived from. We
                            picked this name because we will ensure Serendisco is renowned globally for being the premier music
                            festival of Sri Lanka and our identity is directly tied to our island.</span

                            esteemed festival goers. We felt it was vital to get the best local and international talent on our lineup
                            while also hosting the festival at the best venue possible. But this wasn’t enough for us as we understand
                            this is not just about music. That pushed us to go partner with exciting local brands that provide fun and
                            exciting games and experiences. Attendees can buy tickets at serendisco.appigo.co and we have 3 separate
                            tiers based on when tickets are purchased. We have a very limited supply of 1,000 tickets so I encourage
                            all to buy your tickets soon, before they run out. We believe nowhere around the world would one be able
                            to see these international artists at the price we are offering, especially at a historic hotel that is
                            both beachside and in the heart of the city.</span

                            of, rather than waiting for the world to be ready. If you look at Bali, they have figured out how to
                            position and market themselves to the world, but natural beauty-wise, Bali has no edge on Sri Lanka – if
                            anything we have so much more to offer – from nature to culture to wildlife. Sri Lanka is a tropical
                            paradise that is positioned so well to reap the benefits of events like this. If we bring the best
                            international artists and curate the most exceptional ambience, I believe there will be tons of young
                            adults around the world eagerly waiting to make a trip to Sri Lanka for Serendisco. We need to realize
                            what a huge benefit it is that Sri Lanka remains nice and warm throughout the winter months; folks from
                            Europe will be itching to make a trip to see their favourite artists play in a warm beachside location
                            while their countries see the sunset at 3 pm. My goal is to create a new reason for tourists to visit our
                            island, and once they are here, they will extend their stay to see everything else this beautiful country
                            has to offer.  </span
